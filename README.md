# Java Lab

## Overview

This repository contains **my lab exercises and projects in Java**. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to more advanced topics like exception handling, collections, multithreading, and file I/O. The examples are designed to help understand the fundamentals of Java programming.

### Key Topics:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of data structures like lists, queues, stacks, and trees.
- **Exception Handling**: Handling exceptions and creating custom exception classes.
- **Multithreading**: Creating and managing threads in Java.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using Java's I/O streams.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/Java-Lab.git
   ```

2. **Compile and Run the Java Files**:
   Navigate to the folder containing the `.java` files and compile them using the `javac` command:
   ```bash
   javac filename.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   After compiling, you can run the Java program using:
   ```bash
   java filename
   ```

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Examples demonstrating inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Implementation of data structures such as stacks, queues, and binary trees.
   - Understanding of basic algorithms like searching and sorting.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - How to handle exceptions in Java using `try-catch` blocks and `finally`.
   - Creation of custom exceptions for better error handling.

4. **Multithreading**:
   - Basics of creating and running threads in Java.
   - Thread synchronization techniques to avoid race conditions.

5. **File I/O**:
   - Reading from and writing to files using Java's input and output streams.
